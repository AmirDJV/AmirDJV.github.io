# About me

I am currently employed as a post-doc at the Center for Developmental
Social Neuroscience, [IDC, Herzliya](https://www.idc.ac.il/en/pages/home.aspx). In my PhD I studied how we synchronize to other people we're interacting with through our autonomic measurements (e.g. heart rate, galvanic skin response), brain activity (using EEG), and biomarkers of stress, affiliation, and immunity (oxytocin, cortisol, testosterone, and s-IgA). In addition to my research, I had the privilege to take part in other studies concerning mainly maternal depression, stressful environments, and PTSD.

During my studies and job experiences, I specialized in conducting and analyzing experimental behavioral studies. As such, I acquired statistical and programming (R, Python, MATLAB) skills, led and acted as a consultant for numerous studies, taught statistics and research methods, and [published articles](https://amirdjv.netlify.app/publication/) in scientific peer-reviewed journals.

Besides my studies, I enjoy analyzing new datasets, teaching and consulting about research methods, statistics and data analysis. I preach for the use of R language, and in my spare time, I like photography, traveling, chess, and listing to music.
