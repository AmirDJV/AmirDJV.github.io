<p>The use of <code>library()</code> or <code>require()</code> is interesting. Each have is own pros and cons. If we’ll use the help for library (?library), we’ll see that “library and require load and attach add-on packages”. So, while practicality they do the same thing, they act differently.</p>
<p>In both cases both functions load the packages with name package and put it on the search list. However, When we call <code>library()</code>, if the package doesn’t exists a warning will be raised. In addition, the script will stop running.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(somepackage)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Error in library(somepackage) : there is no package called
## ‘somepackage’)</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, when we call <code>require()</code> the function will return <code>TRUE</code> if the package exists, and <code>FALSE</code> if the package doesn’t exists. furthermore, unlike <code>library()</code>, the script will not stop running.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(require(somepackage))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: somepackage</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE,
## logical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called &#39;somepackage&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>So, why do we care about these differences? Beside knowing what each function does, we can use them to our own advantage.</p>
<p>It’s considered better practice to use <code>library()</code> when we want to load packages outside of functions. This is because we would like to know if and where we have a bug as soon as possible. Calling a set of function which doesn’t exists is certainly a bug. We’ll use <code>require()</code> inside functions, as we can manipulate it’s <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> output. For example, in the beginning of our script, we can write a function that will install all the necessary function if they aren’t already installed <a href="https://amirdjv.netlify.com/post/r-and-rstudio-tricks-and-shortcuts/">look here</a>. We could also skip parts of a script if the packages aren’t already installed, etc.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
