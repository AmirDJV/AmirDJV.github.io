# About me

I need to edit this part about myself.

# I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/). My research interests lie in the application of statistics to study biology (particularly with high-throughput techonolgies), medicine, epidemiology, and public health. I am also interested in how humans interact with data in ways that impact analysis, understanding, and scientific communication.
# 
# I received my PhD in [biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/) from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) where I worked with [Kasper Daniel Hansen](http://www.hansenlab.org/) on statistical methodology for high-throughput biology and with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and [Leah Jager](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2909/leah-r-jager) on understanding the role of human behavior in data analysis.
# 
# My last name is pronounced **mee-int**. A common mispronunciation that is quite understandable given the spelling is my-int. While this can be amusing from a computer science perspective, it is, nevertheless, incorrect!
