Animal studies indicate that the mother's physiology and behavior mediate offspring stress in a system-specific manner, but few studies tested this external-regulatory maternal role in human children exposed to chronic stress.\\textless/p\\textgreater \\textless/sec\\textgreater \\textlesssec secType='methods' id='sec\\_a2'\\textgreater \\textlessspan class=\"bold\"\\textgreaterMethods\\textless/span\\textgreater \\textlessp\\textgreaterWe followed a unique cohort of children exposed to continuous wartime trauma (\\textlessspan class='italic'\\textgreaterN\\textless/span\\textgreater = 177; exposed; \\textlessspan class='italic'\\textgreaterN\\textless/span\\textgreater = 101, controls; \\textlessspan class='italic'\\textgreaterN\\textless/span\\textgreater = 76). At 10 years, maternal and child's salivary immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) and oxytocin (OT), biomarkers of the immune and affiliation systems, were assayed, maternal and child relational behaviors observed, mother and child underwent psychiatric diagnosis, and child anxiety symptoms assessed.\\textless/p\\textgreater \\textless/sec\\textgreater \\textlesssec secType='results' id='sec\\_a3'\\textgreater \\textlessspan class=\"bold\"\\textgreaterResults\\textless/span\\textgreater \\textlessp\\textgreaterWar-exposed mothers had higher s-IgA, lower OT, more anxiety symptoms, and their parenting was characterized by reduced sensitivity. Exposed children showed higher s-IgA, more anxiety disorders and post traumatic stress disorder, and more anxiety symptoms. Path analysis model defined three pathways by which maternal physiology and behavior impacted child anxiety; (a) increasing maternal s-IgA, which led to increased child s-IgA, augmenting child anxiety; (b) reducing maternal OT, which linked with diminished child OT and social repertoire; and (c) increasing maternal anxiety, which directly impacted child anxiety.\\textless/p\\textgreater \\textless/sec\\textgreater \\textlesssec secType='conclusion' id='sec\\_a4'\\textgreater \\textlessspan class=\"bold\"\\textgreaterConclusions\\textless/span\\textgreater \\textlessp\\textgreaterOur findings, the first to measure immune and affiliation biomarkers in mothers and children, detail their unique and joint effects on children's anxiety in response to stress; highlight the relations between chronic stress, immune activation, and anxiety in children; and describe how processes of biobehavioral synchrony shape children's long-term adaptation.\\textless/p\\textgreater \\textless/sec\\textgreater \\textless/div\\textgreater"
