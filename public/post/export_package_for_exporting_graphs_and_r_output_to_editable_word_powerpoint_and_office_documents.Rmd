One of the benefits of using R is the beautiful graphs that you can create easily. However, as sometimes you want to write a document in Word or PowerPoint or you need to collaborate with others who are using these programs, the need to `export` your figures becomes a hassle. Moreover, usually it will be as a non-editable picture. Lately, I found the [`export`](https://github.com/tomwenseleers/export) package which allows you to export your graphs and outputs into a nice and neat editable office objects. 

We should start by installing the package from CRAN: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("export")
```

Another alternative is to use the dev. version from github (make sure you have all the dependencies up to date):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("officer")
install.packages("rvg")
install.packages("openxlsx")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("flextable")
install.packages("xtable")
install.packages("rgl")
install.packages("stargazer")
install.packages("tikzDevice")
install.packages("xml2")
install.packages("broom")
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("tomwenseleers/export")
```

Great, now lets load the package and see the functions we have: 
```{r}
library(export)

ls("package:export") 

```

We can see a certain pattern of `what` to `format`. Thus, we can export for example graphs to pictures (bitmap, jpg, png, tif) or to office documents (PowerPoint, Excel, Word). 

Let's create an example graph and start the exporting. We'll be using the `iris` data-set. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

head(iris)

graph <- iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.Length)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
  
graph
```

And exporting to PowerPoint: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
graph2ppt(graph, file = "myGraph.pptx")
```

As can be seen in the gif below, the exported graph come as a grouped fully editable object:

Same can be done to word:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
graph2doc(graph, file = "myGraph.docx")
```

We can also create a table or output and export it.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
fit <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length*Petal.Width, data = iris)

summary(fit)
```

Into Excel:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
table2excel(summary(fit), file = "fit.xlsx")
```

Lastly, lets say we created a number of graphs and we want them slide after slide in a PowerPoint slide show, how can we do that? 

First we create the graphs:
```{r}
manyGraphs <- iris %>% 
  nest(-Species) %>% 
  mutate(
    graph = purrr::map2(
    .x = data,
    .y = Species, 
    .f = function(x, y) { 
      x %>% 
        ggplot(aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
        ggtitle(y)}))

manyGraphs
```

Now, we can loop over the graphs and add them into the same presentation but in different slides: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

for (i in 1:length(manyGraphs$graph)) {
  graphics.off()
  print(manyGraphs$graph[[i]])
  export::graph2ppt(
    file="myPlotsInPPT.pptx", 
    width=10,
    aspectr=sqrt(2),
    append=TRUE)
  graphics.off()
}
```
